### pre-trained model(s)
The pre-trained model e.g. word2vec, GloVe etc. should be present on the machine **locally** in here. These models are too big (in GBs) for Git.

### Current list of models:
**word2vec**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing
**GloVe**: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
